      "description": "Developers practicing ACDD with fspec need real-time visibility into their project state, work unit status, and task progress. Currently, fspec is a CLI tool tied to development machines, requiring terminal access to check boards, manage work units, or review specifications. When in meetings, commuting, or away from their desk, developers lose connection to their project workflow, making it difficult to plan ahead, update priorities, or stay informed about multi-project status across different machines.",

    "overview": "A Flutter mobile application that connects to a cloud relay server via WebSocket. Each fspec instance (running on developer workstations) also connects to the same relay server using the existing Bridge tool. The relay server routes messages between the mobile app and fspec instances, enabling bidirectional communication: viewing real-time StreamChunks (text, thinking, tool calls) and sending input/control messages. The mobile app maintains connections to multiple relay channels (one per fspec instance), with each channel potentially having multiple fspec sessions connected. This extends the proven Telegram bridge architecture (which separates 'input' and 'control' message types) to a multi-instance mobile context.",
